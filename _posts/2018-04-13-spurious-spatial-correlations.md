I was a bit out of place in my Intro to GIS course during college. Our professor
gave a term assignment where we were to choose a spatial data set and perform some kind of
analysis upon it. The problem I ran into was that I had no spatial data on hand, 
and no practical application to simulate.

Finding data to work with wasn't a big deal. It turns out that there is an absolute 
*wealth* of information online that is both spatial and free. The problem of what to do with the data
remained, though. It was at this point that I found Tyler Vigen's [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com),
a website that draws correlations between (hopefully) unrelated data sets, such as the divorce rate in Maine
and margarine sales per capita over time. I thought it would be funny to do the same with spatial data for Maine.

These are my results.

## Eagles and K-Cups

With the exception of Washington County, eagles seem to make their homes in areas where household K-Cup ownership is at or higher than the national average.

## Schools and Aquifers

589 of Maineâ€™s 795 schools are within 3 km of an aquifer. This means that if you are at a school, there is a 74% chance that you are within walking distance of a significant source of groundwater.

## U.S. Cellular Coverage and Oil Spill Hotspots

US Cellular offers great coverage in areas where hazardous oil spills occur the most.

## Cemeteries and Broadband Coverage

3875 of Maine's 3929 cemeteries are located exactly within broadband coverage areas (98.63%).

## Red Cross Facilities and Bedrock Formation Eras

In what I can only consider to be a deliberate move, Red Cross has built their facilities in Maine on top of bedrock formed before the Devonian era. This means that if you got into a time machine and went back to the period at which the bedrock was formed beneath any Red Cross facility, you would not find sharks, ferns, trees, insects, or land vertebrates.
