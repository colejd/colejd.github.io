  Include vars:
    image_path
        (Path of the image relative to the compiled website's root)
    source_image_path (optional)
        (Path of the image in the build source's root)
        If not specified, image_path is used. The idea is that
        you only specify this parameter if you're not using
        an absolute path that will be the same on the website.
    alt_text (optional)
        (Alt text for the image)
