excerpt: Liquid Math is an interactive simulator for reaction-diffusion systems. Think of it like a sort of lava lamp that you control the behavior of. Or think of it as a drawing program that brings your brush strokes to life. Or think of it as an educational tool for linear algebra. It's up to you.

Liquid Math is a tool for creating art with biological simulations. There are patterns in nature all around you that form spontaneously from surprisingly simple rules. With Liquid Math, you can use these rules to create art with these patterns, which happen naturally in the raised edges of brain corals, pigmentation in animals with stripes, and more. Think of it as a drawing program that brings your brush strokes to life.

To learn a little more, and to try out something similar, try out the prototype web version [here](/projects/reaction-diffusion/).

**Features**:
- 40+ reaction-diffusion presets to get started with.
- Make and save your own simulation rules for later.
- Change the look with deep theme customization.

**Requires iOS 15 / macOS 12 Monterey or later.**
