Dust is a WebGL-based simulator / renderer for various Cellular Automata. The simulation is largely based on [CellAuto](https://sanojian.github.io/cellauto/), and many of the automata came from there (see the repo for this project on [GitHub](href="https://github.com/colejd/Dust") for more information). My goals with this are to add interactivity and graphical features as time goes on.
