I'm a software developer living in Boston, where I help build world-class iOS and augmented reality apps as a Senior Developer at Raizlabs (now [Rightpoint](https://www.rightpoint.com/)). Before that, I was part of the [Virtual Environment and Multimodal Interaction Laboratory](https://umaine.edu/vemi/), where I worked at the forefront of human-computer interaction and psychospatial research with VR and AR. I'm skilled with iOS, AR, VR, and computer vision.

That's just a surface look at my work, a lot of which is open-source on [Github]({{- site.github_url -}}). If you're interested, you can see more about me on my [resume](/resume), or [get in touch via email](mailto:{{- site.email -}}).
