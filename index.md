I'm a software developer living in Boston, where I help build world-class iOS apps at [Raizlabs](https://www.raizlabs.com/). Before I did that, I worked at the [Virtual Environment and Multimodal Interaction Laboratory](http://www.vemilab.org/), where I trailblazed new tech and innovation in human-computer interaction and psychospatial research with VR and AR.

I love hard problems. I've done projects ranging from AR visualization frameworks to fully immersive VR driving simulators to full-stack web apps to occupancy grid vectorizers for cleaning robots. If you want something done, give me a week.

Are you a museum? I've worked on three installations at the [Discovery Museum](https://www.mainediscoverymuseum.org/) in Bangor, Maine, and I'd love to make one for you. <a href="mailto:{{- site.email -}}" class="stand-out">Let's get in touch!</a>
